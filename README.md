# session2
Session 2 - Object Mutability and Interning - Practice Assignment

### Description of the module:
This is for session 2 assignment with some functions to test the performance and memory management 

##### Original functions and methods:
- Originally, these were the classes in the session2.py:
Something
SomethingNew

- Also, these were the function defined in session2.py:
add_something
reserved_function
clear_memory
critical_function
compare_strings_old
compare_strings_new

Additionally, '__init__' is using the functionality from the parent class - object

##### Problem Statement:

In the original code, there we will be leaking memory because we are creating cyclic reference. 
Find that we are indeed making cyclic references.
Eventually memory will be released, but that is currently not happening immediately.
We have added a function called "clear_memory" but it is not able to do it's job. Fix it. 
Refer to test_clear_memory Test in test_session2.py to see how we're crudely finding that
this code is sub-optimal.


##### Changes made to the original code to pass tests:
- Added support for the class Something to provide object representation by overwriting "__repr__"  
- Added support for the class SomethingNew to provide object representation by overwriting "__repr__"  
- Corrections made to the function name(i.e, removed capitalization). Changed reserved_Function() to reserved_function()  
- Imported gc module and added functionality to ensure garbage collection  
- Added following Docstring to clear_memory function:  
clear_memory(): After collection.clear() python's memory manager will not be able to clear
the cyclic references that's created during creation of List(Something) because of instantiating
the same class and assigning it to the same subclass.
By invoking Garbage Collector through gc.collect(), we are ensuring that we clear
the reachable cyclic references and clearing out the consumed memory by those cyclic references.  
- Defined the program: compare_strings_new with following differences from the compare_strings_old:
used set instead of list  
used is instead of =, thereby ensuring comparison using identity operator rather than equality operator. This makes computing fast  
- removed line no. 66 in original code under compare_strings_new:
time.sleep(6) # remove this line, this is just to simulate your "slow" code
- improved efficiency of the iteration through char_list
